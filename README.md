# ShoeCart

A React-Redux web application that is a shopping cart for different types of sneakers. Users can sort the products depending on the price and they can add products to the cart. Once in the shopping cart, they can either remove items or add more of a particular item to the cart. Users can check out using Stripe when they have chosen the items they want.
